# Application and Hardware Boundaries

## Consumer-Owned Typed Ports

Application services define only the dependencies required by their use case.
For example, `internal/application/messaging/service.go` defines `Repository`,
`LineSource`, `Sender`, `Inbox`, and `SubmitReportInbox`; its
`SendSMSCommand` carries business IDs, destination, body, and encoded segments
but deliberately carries no AT/QMI text or device path. Follow this shape when
adding a transport or repository capability:

- accept `context.Context` on I/O and long-running work;
- use typed commands/results and stable domain IDs;
- validate mandatory dependencies in constructors (`messaging.NewService`,
  `line.New`, and `modem.New` are current examples);
- add the smallest method needed by the current vertical slice.

The HTTP layer follows the same rule. Interfaces such as `Messenger`,
`ManagedLineManager`, and `VoWiFiManager` in
`internal/api/httpapi/server.go` express handler needs and keep concrete
assembly in `cmd/simplusd/main.go`.

## Scenario: Retired ResourceGroup lease application contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract when considering a ResourceGroup lease feature, changing
the retained runtime lease tables/repository, or introducing an application
repository whose methods use persistence-owned values. An interface named
`Repository` is not a layer boundary when its parameters, results, or enum
branches are owned by `internal/storage/sqlite`.

The former `internal/application/resourcelease` package was never assembled by
a production binary and has been removed. Do not recreate it merely to expose
the historical SQLite fixture.

### 2. Signatures

These current signatures belong only to the dormant storage fixture in
`internal/storage/sqlite/resource_leases.go`:

```go
func (*Set) AcquireResourceGroupLease(
    context.Context,
    ResourceLeaseAcquire,
) (ResourceLease, bool, error)

func (*Set) RenewResourceGroupLease(
    context.Context,
    string,
    uint64,
    time.Time,
    time.Time,
) (ResourceLease, error)

func (*Set) ReleaseResourceGroupLease(context.Context, string, uint64) error
func (*Set) ActiveResourceGroupLeases(
    context.Context,
    string,
    time.Time,
) ([]ResourceLease, error)
```

`ResourceLeaseAcquire`, `ResourceLease`, `ResourceLeaseOperation`, and
`ResourceLeaseCall` are SQLite-package vocabulary. No supported application
signature accepts, returns, aliases, or re-exports them.

### 3. Contracts

- `internal/application/resourcelease` must remain absent unless a newly
  approved current product feature establishes a real application use case.
- A future use case defines its request/result/kind vocabulary in the
  application or protocol-neutral domain owner first. A concrete SQLite
  adapter maps those values at the persistence boundary.
- Application validation must not branch on SQLite constants or treat the
  retained storage record as the business source of truth.
- Runtime migration `00005_resource_group_leases.sql`, the SQLite repository,
  and its focused test are historical compatibility/fixture infrastructure,
  not evidence of a production capability.
- Removing dead application code does not authorize a schema change, deletion
  of stored rows, a new command/API, or activation of the separate Agent
  `radio.ensure-off` outcome/fencing ledger.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Application port accepts/returns `sqlite.ResourceLease*` | reject the design; define application/domain values and an explicit mapping |
| Application code aliases a SQLite lease type or branches on its kind constants | reject as persistence vocabulary leaking upward |
| No production caller and the old application policy is obsolete | remove the complete application package; do not preserve an unused facade |
| Dead application package is removed | retain the released migration and existing rows unchanged |
| A future product feature genuinely needs leasing | approve a new task, define the current business contract, then implement and test the mapping |
| A future change wants to drop lease tables or data | require a separately approved migration/data-compatibility decision and a new migration; never rewrite runtime v5 |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a future vertical slice defines application-owned lease intent and a
  narrow repository, while a SQLite adapter explicitly converts to its storage
  representation and focused tests prove the round trip.
- Base: the dormant SQLite repository, real-SQLite tests, and embedded runtime
  migration remain isolated with no application import or production caller.
- Bad: recreate `application/resourcelease`, alias `sqlite.ResourceLease`, or
  call the SQLite fixture from an executable because the old tables already
  exist.

### 6. Tests Required

- Focused scans must find no `internal/application/resourcelease` package and
  no application use of `sqlite.ResourceLease*` or the SQLite lease-kind
  constants.
- `internal/storage/sqlite/resource_leases_test.go` remains the focused
  real-SQLite evidence for replay, fencing, expiry/reopen, conflict, and
  concurrent acquisition behavior while the fixture is retained.
- Run `go test -count=1 ./internal/storage/sqlite`, then the supported
  `./cmd/... ./internal/...` test/vet/lint scope to catch hidden imports or
  production wiring.
- A task that does not change OpenAPI, generated sources, or migrations must
  still run generated-drift and protected-file diff checks. No service,
  private runtime database, hardware, or HIL validation is required.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```go
// Wrong: the interface name hides a concrete persistence contract.
type Repository interface {
    Acquire(context.Context, sqlite.ResourceLeaseAcquire) (
        sqlite.ResourceLease, bool, error,
    )
}

// Correct current shape: no application ResourceGroup lease contract exists.
// The retained methods stay inside internal/storage/sqlite and are called only
// by the storage-focused compatibility tests.

// If a separately approved feature needs leasing, that task defines its
// business vocabulary first and adds an explicit persistence mapping; this
// retired contract does not prescribe the future API.
```

## Scenario: HTTP-owned adjacent application ports

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract when changing `httpapi.Server`, `httpapi.New`, Setup or
inventory handlers, system health, authenticated realtime streaming, or
`WithRealtime`. HTTP owns the operations it consumes; `cmd/simplusd` owns the
concrete application implementations supplied at runtime.

### 2. Signatures

The HTTP boundary owns these exact roles:

```go
type HealthReader interface {
    Snapshot(context.Context) (health.Snapshot, error)
}

type SetupManager interface {
    Status(context.Context) (setup.Status, error)
    ConsumeBootstrap(context.Context, string) (setup.SessionGrant, error)
    ReadSession(context.Context, string) (setup.Session, error)
    ConfigureAdministrator(context.Context, string, setup.AdministratorInput) (setup.Session, error)
    ConfigureStorage(context.Context, string, setup.StorageInput) (setup.Session, error)
    ConfigureHTTPS(context.Context, string, setup.HTTPSInput) (setup.Session, error)
    ConfirmHTTPS(context.Context, string, string) (setup.Session, error)
    ReadRootCertificate(context.Context, string) ([]byte, string, error)
    ConfirmHardwareReview(context.Context, string, setup.HardwareReviewInput) (setup.Session, error)
    Complete(context.Context, string, setup.HardwareReviewInput) (setup.Completion, error)
    BeginAdministratorSetup(context.Context) (setup.SessionGrant, error)
}

type InventoryReader interface {
    Snapshot(context.Context) (inventory.Snapshot, error)
    Topology(context.Context) (inventory.Topology, error)
}

type RealtimeManager interface {
    Subscribe() *realtime.Subscription
    Publish([]realtime.Topic, realtime.Attention)
}
```

`Server` stores those four interfaces. The first three `New` parameters use
the corresponding roles, and `WithRealtime(*Server, RealtimeManager)` supplies
the fourth. Argument order, logger defaults, variadic contacts and the
`*Server` return shape remain unchanged.

### 3. Contracts

- Every method above has a live HTTP call. Setup deliberately excludes
  `GenerateBootstrap` and `ProvisionAdministrator`, which belong to other
  composition/control paths.
- Application-owned typed inputs and results may appear in port signatures;
  concrete application implementation pointers may not appear in HTTP fields
  or construction parameters.
- `cmd/simplusd` injects the existing `*health.Service`, `*setup.Service`,
  `*inventory.Service`, and `*realtime.Hub` by structural satisfaction. Do not
  add an adapter or move concrete selection into HTTP.
- Interface values are stored unchanged. `httpDependencyMissing` is used only
  by `StreamEvents`, `realtimeSessionValid`, `publish`, and `Login` so those
  optional availability decisions treat typed nil as absent.
- Do not normalize typed-nil Health/Setup/Inventory values to a true nil
  interface: their concrete nil-receiver methods return the existing bounded
  configuration errors used by HTTP mappings.
- This boundary refactor changes no OpenAPI schema/route, cookie, status/error
  code, Setup transition, health/inventory payload, realtime topic/attention,
  heartbeat/session behavior, generated source or application implementation.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Production concrete services and Hub | structurally satisfy the four ports; no wrapper or caller behavior change |
| Independent fake implementations | `New`/`WithRealtime` accept them without a concrete service value |
| raw or typed-nil Setup in Login/realtime validation | treat as absent; skip optional Login Setup work and fail realtime validation closed |
| raw or typed-nil Realtime manager | stream returns `EVENT_STREAM_UNAVAILABLE`; publication is a no-op |
| typed-nil concrete Health/Setup/Inventory called by a handler | dispatch its nil-receiver method and retain the pre-refactor bounded error path |
| extra method added to a port | focused exact-method-set test fails until a live HTTP need is demonstrated |
| `WithRealtime(nil, manager)` | return nil without dereferencing the server |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: production supplies the existing services, while an HTTP test supplies
  four recording fakes and observes the same bounded mapping/publication flow.
- Base: realtime is not configured; authenticated stream setup returns the
  existing stable unavailable error and ordinary publish calls do nothing.
- Bad: store `*setup.Service` directly, add every exported Setup method to the
  interface, normalize typed nil to true nil, or introduce a general service
  registry/event bus.

### 6. Tests Required

- Compile-time assertions for all four production implementations and four
  independent fake implementations.
- A handwritten exact method-name assertion for each interface, including the
  negative absence of Setup's control-only methods.
- Fake-only construction plus observable `Subscribe` and `Publish` calls.
- Raw/typed-nil optional availability cases and separate typed-nil concrete
  Health/Setup/Inventory receiver-error cases.
- Existing `httptest` coverage for Setup gates, Health/Inventory mapping,
  authenticated SSE, heartbeat/session expiry and publication remains green.
- Run focused HTTP and command tests under `-race`, then the supported
  `./cmd/... ./internal/...` tests/vet/lint and generated-drift checks.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```go
// Wrong: concrete coupling plus an interface conversion that loses nil state.
type Server struct { setup *setup.Service }
if server.setupPort != nil { // typed-nil pointer inside the interface is non-nil
    _, _ = server.setupPort.Status(ctx)
}

// Correct: consumer-owned port and typed-nil-aware optional availability.
type Server struct { setup SetupManager }
if !httpDependencyMissing(server.setup) {
    _, _ = server.setup.Status(ctx)
}
```

## Scenario: Background coordination and realtime invalidation

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract whenever an executable starts a polling or long-polling
loop whose result determines notification intent, realtime invalidation,
attention metadata, retry policy, or other business meaning. The executable
owns construction, configured intervals, goroutine lifetime, shutdown and
operational log rendering. The owning application package owns result
interpretation, event/topic selection, side-effect ordering and retry state.

### 2. Signatures

The current SMS coordinator in `internal/application/messaging` consumes:

```go
type InboundSyncer interface {
    SyncInbound(context.Context) (InboundSyncResult, error)
}
type NotificationSender interface {
    NotifyReceivedSMS(context.Context, string, string) error
    NotifyReceivedSMSSummary(context.Context, int) error
}
type RealtimePublisher interface {
    Publish([]realtime.Topic, realtime.Attention)
}

func NewSyncCoordinator(InboundSyncer, NotificationSender, RealtimePublisher) (*SyncCoordinator, error)
func (*SyncCoordinator) Run(context.Context, time.Duration, func(SyncReport))
```

The Agent change coordinator in `internal/application/inventory` consumes a
separate smallest source instead of widening the Snapshot/Probe `AgentClient`:

```go
type AgentChangeSource interface {
    Snapshot(context.Context, bool) (agentapi.Snapshot, error)
    Changes(context.Context, string, uint64, int) (agentapi.ChangeResponse, error)
}
type AgentChangePublisher interface {
    Publish([]realtime.Topic, realtime.Attention)
}

func NewAgentChangeCoordinator(AgentChangeSource, AgentChangePublisher) (*AgentChangeCoordinator, error)
func (*AgentChangeCoordinator) Run(context.Context, func(AgentChangeReport))
```

`InboundSyncResult` keeps counters as its public reporting surface and carries
an unexported, narrow `{Sender, Body}` value for every newly persisted inbound
SMS. `SyncReport` carries the typed result, synchronization error, joined
notification error and durable-change decision. `AgentChangeReport` carries
operation `snapshot | changes` plus the source error. These reports let
`cmd/simplusd` preserve operational logs without importing `slog` into the
application coordinators or exposing SMS bodies to the executable.

### 3. Contracts

- SMS runs once immediately. Each `SyncInbound` call is bounded to 20 seconds.
  `Persisted`, `AlreadyKnown`, `OutboundSent`, `OutboundFailed` or
  `OutboundUnconfirmed` publishes `messages`; acknowledgement-only counters do
  not. Only `Persisted > 0` attaches `sms.received` attention.
- Each successful first persistence appends exactly one private `{Sender,
  Body}` notification value in discovery order. A repository replay appends
  none. If persistence succeeds and acknowledgement fails, the partial result
  retains the value, so that cycle notifies once and the later replay does not
  notify again. Pass this narrow value instead of a domain `sms.Message`.
- Single-part inbound, outbound and fully assembled multipart bodies share the
  same validation: non-blank valid UTF-8, at most 1600 runes and at most 6400
  bytes. Revalidate after multipart assembly before persistence; validating
  fragments alone is insufficient.
- For every private value, the coordinator calls `NotifyReceivedSMS` in
  discovery order under a fresh, detached 15-second context. Calls are
  sequential and independent: collect an indexed, content-free error and
  continue after a failure or timeout. After all per-SMS calls, invoke
  `NotifyReceivedSMSSummary` once under its own detached 15-second context.
- The notification service renders each Feishu-only message as
  `[Simplus] 新短信\n发件人：<sender>\n内容：\n<body>` and preserves the complete
  body, including Unicode and line breaks. The count summary remains once per
  synchronization cycle for enabled non-Feishu channels only; SMS content must
  never be sent to those channels. Existing generic notification behavior
  remains unchanged.
- The coordinator publishes `notifications` after all notification attempts,
  including when any delivery fails. Channel delivery status reflects the
  latest individual attempt. Only the synchronization error selects retry;
  notification failures are joined for reporting and never trigger a sync
  retry or a persistent notification outbox.
- SMS intervals below one second normalize to two seconds. Synchronization
  failure begins at `max(15s, interval*4)`, doubles to five minutes and resets
  after a successful synchronization. Partial durable results are still
  published/notified before the error selects retry.
- Agent watching starts with `Snapshot(ctx, false)` and calls `Changes` with
  the current instance ID, generation and 25-second wait. Explicit changes and
  instance/generation differences after reconnect publish exactly
  `inventory`, `modems`, and `lines`, without attention.
- Agent retry starts at one second, doubles to 30 seconds and resets after a
  successful change response. Cancellation stops pending retry waits. The
  coordinator publishes no snapshot/device payload through realtime.
- Each coordinator owns its consumer interfaces even though the concrete
  `realtime.Hub` implements both structurally. Do not replace them with a
  generic background framework, catch-all event bus or concrete Hub field.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Any required SMS coordinator dependency is nil | `ErrSyncCoordinatorConfiguration`; do not start the loop |
| Any required Agent coordinator dependency is nil | `ErrAgentChangeCoordinatorConfiguration`; do not start the loop |
| SMS result contains N newly persisted values | publish `messages`, attempt N ordered Feishu content notifications with fresh deadlines, attempt one non-Feishu count summary, then publish `notifications` |
| One per-SMS Feishu attempt fails or times out | join an indexed error without sender/body, continue with every later SMS and the non-Feishu summary; a successful sync keeps the normal interval |
| Persistence succeeds but acknowledgement fails | retain and notify the private value in the partial result, report the sync error, then use retry delay; the replay must not notify again |
| Repository reports the SMS as already known | increment `AlreadyKnown` but append no private notification value and send no SMS-content notification |
| Assembled multipart body exceeds the shared SMS limit | return `ErrInboundSync` before persistence; do not expose a partial assembled message |
| SMS result contains only acknowledgement counters | no realtime publication or notification |
| Agent initial snapshot fails | report operation `snapshot`, wait with bounded retry, retain prior successful snapshot |
| Agent long-poll fails | report operation `changes`, reconnect with bounded retry |
| Reconnected instance or generation differs | publish Inventory/Modems/Lines once before resuming long-poll |
| Parent context is cancelled | stop pending interval/retry waits promptly and cancel in-flight sync/Agent source contexts; each notification already started or subsequently required by the completed result remains detached and individually bounded by its own 15-second deadline |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: One sync discovers two new SMS messages. The first Feishu attempt
  fails, the second is still attempted with its own deadline, non-Feishu
  channels receive one count summary, notification invalidation is published,
  and the joined error contains only the ordinal and delivery error.
- Base: A replayed SMS increments `AlreadyKnown` without another content
  notification. Independently, an unchanged Agent long-poll updates the
  current snapshot, resets retry and continues without publishing.
- Bad: pass a complete `sms.Message` through the coordinator, reuse one timeout
  across the batch, stop after the first Feishu failure, send body text to
  WeCom, omit post-assembly body validation, or construct notification policy
  in `cmd/simplusd`.

### 6. Tests Required

- `messaging/service_test.go`, `messaging/vowifi_sms_test.go` and inbound tests:
  first-persistence-only private values, exact discovery order, persisted
  sender/body, replay/restart suppression, persistence-plus-ACK-error partial
  results, complete multipart body, and rejection after oversized assembly.
- `messaging/sync_coordinator_test.go`: required dependencies, exact
  sync→Messages→ordered per-SMS attempts→summary→Notifications order, a fresh
  detached/bounded context per attempt, continuation after failure, content-free
  joined errors, acknowledgement-only behavior, retry isolation/reset/cap and
  cancellation.
- `notification/service_test.go`: exact Unicode and multiline Feishu text in
  webhook and app modes, Feishu/non-Feishu provider filtering, latest-attempt
  status, validation and delivery errors, and no body leakage to other channel
  types.
- `inventory/change_coordinator_test.go`: non-probing snapshot and exact
  long-poll arguments, explicit change, instance restart, generation change,
  unchanged reconnect, typed failure reporting, retry reset/cap and
  cancellation.
- `cmd/simplusd` tests retain executable-only helpers; focused ownership scans
  must find no command-local SMS body, notification policy, SMS/Agent topic
  mapping or backoff functions; operational logs remain counter/error-only.
- Run the coordinator packages and `cmd/simplusd` under `go test -race`, then
  run the supported `./cmd/... ./internal/...` test/vet scope.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```go
// Wrong: collapse multiple SMS messages into one Feishu summary.
if result.Persisted > 0 {
    notifications.Notify(ctx, "sms.received",
        fmt.Sprintf("[Simplus] 收到 %d 条新短信", result.Persisted))
}

// Correct: the application coordinator attempts each SMS independently.
for index, received := range result.receivedSMS {
    deliveryCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.WithoutCancel(ctx), 15*time.Second)
    if err := notifications.NotifyReceivedSMS(deliveryCtx, received.Sender, received.Body); err != nil {
        notificationErr = errors.Join(notificationErr,
            fmt.Errorf("received SMS %d: %w", index+1, err))
    }
    cancel()
}
summaryCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.WithoutCancel(ctx), 15*time.Second)
if err := notifications.NotifyReceivedSMSSummary(summaryCtx, result.Persisted); err != nil {
    notificationErr = errors.Join(notificationErr,
        fmt.Errorf("received SMS summary: %w", err))
}
cancel()
```

## Scenario: Explicit Setup dependencies and concrete adapter assembly

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract when changing `internal/application/setup`, any Setup
constructor caller, the instance secret-key path, private-directory validation,
password hashing, or Local CA generation. Setup owns its state machine,
validation and side-effect ordering. The `cmd/simplusd` composition root owns
which concrete SQLite, password, filesystem, secretbox and certificate
implementations satisfy those needs.

Setup is an active OpenAPI/HTTP/Web flow. Do not delete or simplify it as part
of a dependency repair, and do not put concrete defaults back into the
application package for caller convenience.

### 2. Signatures

The application constructor accepts named dependencies and returns a stable
configuration error:

```go
type Dependencies struct {
    StateStore            StateStore
    AuthorizationStore    AuthorizationStore
    AdministratorStore    AdministratorStore
    PasswordHasher        PasswordHasher
    StorageStore          StorageStore
    DirectoryPreparer     DirectoryPreparer
    ManagementTLSStore    ManagementTLSStore
    SecretProtectorOpener SecretProtectorOpener
    LocalCAGenerator      LocalCAGenerator
    HardwareReviewStore   HardwareReviewStore
    CompletionStore       CompletionStore
    Random                io.Reader
    Now                   func() time.Time
}

func New(Dependencies) (*Service, error)
```

Filesystem and certificate adapters translate into application-owned values:

```go
type DirectoryIdentity struct {
    Path string
    Device, Inode uint64
}
type DirectoryPreparer func(string) (DirectoryIdentity, error)

type LocalCABundle struct {
    CACertificatePEM, CAPrivateKeyPEM       []byte
    LeafCertificatePEM, LeafPrivateKeyPEM   []byte
    RootFingerprint                         string
    LeafNotAfter                            time.Time
    SANs                                    []string
}
type LocalCAGenerator func(time.Time, []string) (LocalCABundle, error)
```

`cmd/simplusd/setup.go:newSetupService(*sqlite.Set, instanceSecretKeyPath)` is
the production assembly seam. `main.go` derives the path argument from its
configured database root; no separate API, environment variable or request
field selects the Setup key path.

### 3. Contracts

- `StateStore` is mandatory. Other nil fields explicitly mean that capability
  is unavailable and existing method-level configuration errors remain
  authoritative. A StateStore-only service is a valid narrow fixture for
  Setup/ready-state gates.
- AdministratorStore/PasswordHasher, StorageStore/DirectoryPreparer, and
  SecretProtectorOpener/LocalCAGenerator are all-or-none pairs. The Local CA
  pair additionally requires ManagementTLSStore. `New` wraps
  `ErrDependenciesInvalid` for every invalid shape; it never discovers roles
  by asserting another dependency's dynamic type.
- Nil `Random` and `Now` select `crypto/rand.Reader` and `time.Now`. Bootstrap
  and session lifetimes remain ten and thirty minutes. Tests inject these
  seams through `Dependencies`, not by assigning private Service fields.
- Production assigns the same SQLite Set separately to every persistence role,
  selects `password.NewDefaultHasher`, translates all three directory identity
  fields, and translates all seven Local CA bundle fields.
- `databaseRoot/.simplus-secrets-key-v1` is derived once in `cmd/simplusd` and
  used by both the lazy Setup SecretProtector opener and the existing instance
  keyring. `setup.Dependencies` carries no key-path field, and production
  exposes no independent key-path selector.
- Local CA mode retains the exact encryption labels
  `management-tls-ca-private-key-v1` and
  `management-tls-leaf-private-key-v1`. After both encryptions succeed, Setup
  clears both plaintext key buffers before calling `ConfigureManagementTLS`
  with the same `managementtls.Configuration` fields. Directory device/inode
  range and completion preflight checks are unchanged.
- This constructor refactor changes no OpenAPI, HTTP error, cookie, generated
  source, SQLite schema/data, cryptographic format, certificate lifetime,
  setup transition or Web behavior.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| StateStore missing | constructor returns `ErrDependenciesInvalid` |
| Exactly one of AdministratorStore / PasswordHasher present | constructor returns `ErrDependenciesInvalid` |
| Exactly one of StorageStore / DirectoryPreparer present | constructor returns `ErrDependenciesInvalid` |
| Exactly one of SecretProtectorOpener / LocalCAGenerator present | constructor returns `ErrDependenciesInvalid` |
| Local CA pair present without ManagementTLSStore | constructor returns `ErrDependenciesInvalid` |
| Optional capability absent and its operation is called | existing bounded “not configured” error; never panic or infer a fallback |
| StateStore-only dependency set | valid Service; Status/gates work, unrelated mutations remain unavailable |
| Production dependency set incomplete | `cmd/simplusd` logs Setup dependency configuration failure, closes stores and exits non-zero |
| LocalCAGenerator returns an error | existing `ErrHTTPSRequestInvalid` mapping; no key/certificate persistence |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: `cmd/simplusd` passes explicit roles and adapters, Setup receives only
  application values, and Local CA private keys are encrypted/cleared before
  the unchanged configuration is persisted.
- Base: an HTTP test needs only ready-state gating and constructs
  `setup.New(setup.Dependencies{StateStore: fixedState})`; no SQLite concrete
  capabilities appear implicitly.
- Bad: `setup.New(store, store)` type-asserts the first store into hidden roles,
  imports secretbox/filesystem/managementcert, or assembles a key path inside
  the application package.

### 6. Tests Required

- `internal/application/setup/service_test.go`: missing StateStore, each incomplete
  pair, Local CA without TLS, valid State-only and full dependency shapes;
  deterministic clock/random injection and adapter fakes with no private-field
  assignment.
- Setup behavior tests: exact directory identity persistence/range checks,
  Local CA bundle-to-configuration mapping, exact SecretProtector labels and
  ciphertext mapping, plaintext private-key clearing after both encryptions
  succeed, session lifetimes, hardware review and completion preflight.
- `cmd/simplusd/setup_test.go`: a temporary SQLite Set is accepted by the full
  production assembly and constructing the Service does not eagerly open the
  lazy Setup secret protector.
- Control and HTTP tests: explicit exercised/full dependencies preserve
  bootstrap, session, Setup endpoint and ready-state-gate behavior.
- Focused scans find no concrete security/storage import, StateStore role
  assertion or private Service-field injection in application Setup; run the
  affected packages under `go test -race`, then the supported
  `./cmd/... ./internal/...` test/vet scope.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```go
// Wrong: application construction selects hidden implementations by dynamic type.
setupService := setup.New(stores, stores)

// Correct: the executable composition root supplies every production role.
instanceSecretKeyPath := filepath.Join(databaseRoot, ".simplus-secrets-key-v1")
setupService, err := newSetupService(stores, instanceSecretKeyPath)
if err != nil {
    logger.Error("Setup dependency configuration failed", "error", err)
    _ = stores.Close()
    return 1
}
```

## Scenario: Explicit Mihomo supervisor composition

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract when changing `RuntimeManager` in
`internal/application/mihomo`, its constructor,
`SIMPLUS_MIHOMO_SUPERVISOR_SOCKET`, or local/socket Mihomo supervisor
selection. The application owns selected-subscription intent, artifact
readiness, persisted running state and restart/rollback semantics. The
`cmd/simplusd` composition root owns which concrete supervisor implementation
satisfies the typed runtime capability.

### 2. Signatures

The application constructor has one explicit, error-returning form:

```go
var ErrRuntimeManagerConfiguration = errors.New(
    "Mihomo runtime manager dependencies are invalid",
)

func NewRuntimeManager(
    root string,
    store RuntimeStore,
    artifacts ArtifactResolver,
    core CoreStatusReader,
    supervisor mihomosupervisor.API,
) (*RuntimeManager, error)
```

The executable owns the concrete selection seam:

```go
func newMihomoSupervisor(
    root string,
    socketPath string,
) (mihomosupervisor.API, error)
```

### 3. Contracts

- `root` is the absolute `filepath.Join(cfg.Storage.DataRoot, "mihomo")`.
  `NewRuntimeManager` requires an absolute root and cleans it before storing it.
- `RuntimeStore`, `ArtifactResolver`, `CoreStatusReader` and
  `mihomosupervisor.API` are all mandatory. Nil and typed-nil dependencies wrap
  `ErrRuntimeManagerConfiguration`; construction never returns a manager that
  can fail later because one of these dependencies is absent.
- Empty `SIMPLUS_MIHOMO_SUPERVISOR_SOCKET` explicitly selects
  `mihomosupervisor.NewLocal(root)` for the existing development/Simulator
  mode. A non-empty value must be an absolute Unix-socket path and selects
  `mihomosupervisor.NewClient(socketPath)`.
- Both concrete constructors only validate/normalize paths and allocate
  in-memory state: selecting local mode does not start Mihomo, and selecting
  socket mode does not dial netd. Supervisor filesystem/process/socket I/O
  starts only when the application invokes `Status`, `Start` or `Stop` on the
  injected typed API.
- `newMihomoSupervisor` translates either concrete-constructor failure into a
  true nil API. `main.go` logs the bounded configuration failure, closes the
  stores and exits with code 2. Application dependency configuration failure
  also closes the stores and exits non-zero (currently code 1).
- Compose production supplies the absolute netd socket and remains
  socket-backed. Empty-socket local mode is not a production fallback.
- Fixed artifact readiness, generated-config checks and restart rollback stay
  in `internal/application/mihomo`; supervisor request-path/process validation
  and concrete process lifecycle stay in `internal/mihomosupervisor`. Do not
  move either behavior into `cmd/simplusd` while fixing composition.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Empty or relative application root | `NewRuntimeManager` returns nil and wraps `ErrRuntimeManagerConfiguration` |
| Any required dependency is nil or typed nil | constructor returns nil and wraps `ErrRuntimeManagerConfiguration` |
| Empty socket plus absolute root | select `*mihomosupervisor.Local`; do not execute a process |
| Empty socket plus relative root | return a true nil API and the local-constructor error; startup stops |
| Absolute socket path | select `*mihomosupervisor.Client`; do not contact the socket during construction |
| Relative socket path | return a true nil API and the client-constructor error; startup stops |
| Valid supervisor but invalid application dependencies | close stores and exit non-zero before HTTP/background assembly |
| Runtime `Start`/`Stop`/`Status`/`Restart` fails | preserve existing typed application/supervisor error mapping and rollback semantics; do not select another implementation |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: Compose passes an absolute netd socket; `cmd/simplusd` constructs the
  Unix client, injects it once, and the application knows only the typed API.
- Base: local development leaves the socket empty; the command constructs a
  local supervisor but no child process starts until `RuntimeManager.Start` or
  `RuntimeManager.Restart` issues a typed `Start` request.
- Bad: an application convenience constructor calls `NewLocal`, discards its
  error, infers local mode from a missing dependency, or silently falls back
  from a failed socket client to a local process.

### 6. Tests Required

- `internal/application/mihomo/runtime_test.go` injects a recording fake,
  asserts the selected subscription, binary path, absolute generated-config
  path, pending-restart state and one stop call, and covers empty/relative
  root plus nil and typed-nil mandatory dependencies with `errors.Is`.
- `cmd/simplusd/mihomo_test.go` asserts concrete local/socket selection and
  true-nil error returns for invalid paths. A deliberately missing absolute
  socket proves construction does not dial it.
- `internal/mihomosupervisor` retains the concrete process/client behavior
  tests. Application runtime tests may create synthetic artifact files needed
  by readiness checks, but must not launch a process.
- Focused scans must find one `NewRuntimeManager` constructor, no
  `NewRuntimeManagerWithSupervisor`, no application call to `NewLocal`, and no
  discarded concrete-constructor error. Run focused packages under
  `go test -race`, then the supported `./cmd/... ./internal/...` test/vet scope.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```go
// Wrong: the application hides a concrete default and its failure.
func NewRuntimeManager(root string, store RuntimeStore, artifacts ArtifactResolver, core CoreStatusReader) *RuntimeManager {
    local, _ := mihomosupervisor.NewLocal(root)
    return &RuntimeManager{Supervisor: local}
}

// Correct: cmd owns implementation choice and the application requires it.
supervisor, err := newMihomoSupervisor(mihomoRoot, mihomoSupervisorSocket)
if err != nil {
    logger.Error("Mihomo supervisor configuration failed", "error", err)
    _ = stores.Close()
    return 2
}
runtime, err := mihomoapp.NewRuntimeManager(
    mihomoRoot, stores, configManager, coreManager, supervisor,
)
if err != nil {
    logger.Error("Mihomo runtime manager dependency configuration failed", "error", err)
    _ = stores.Close()
    return 1
}
```

## Scenario: Typed legacy Webhook delivery port

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract when changing `internal/application/notification`, the
legacy enterprise WeChat/Feishu bot Webhook protocol, notification Service
construction, delivery outcome persistence, or the concrete client assembled
in `cmd/simplusd`. The application owns channel/event/secret/state policy. The
`internal/notificationwebhook` adapter owns fixed target and wire behavior.

Feishu application registration/private-message delivery remains the separate
`FeishuRegistrar`/`FeishuMessenger` path. Do not merge it into the legacy
Webhook adapter or use this seam to create a generic HTTP provider.

### 2. Signatures

The application owns the bounded port vocabulary:

```go
type WebhookProvider string

const (
    WebhookProviderWeCom  WebhookProvider = "wecom"
    WebhookProviderFeishu WebhookProvider = "feishu"
)

type WebhookTarget struct { URL, Hint string }

type WebhookDeliveryRequest struct {
    Provider      WebhookProvider
    URL           string
    SigningSecret string
    Message       string
    Timestamp     int64
}

type WebhookDeliveryOutcome string

const (
    WebhookDelivered      WebhookDeliveryOutcome = "delivered"
    WebhookNetworkFailed  WebhookDeliveryOutcome = "network_failed"
    WebhookRejected       WebhookDeliveryOutcome = "rejected"
)

type WebhookDeliveryResult struct { Outcome WebhookDeliveryOutcome }

type WebhookPort interface {
    ValidateTarget(WebhookProvider, string) (WebhookTarget, error)
    Deliver(context.Context, WebhookDeliveryRequest) (WebhookDeliveryResult, error)
}

type Dependencies struct {
    Store    Store
    Secrets  SecretCipher
    Webhooks WebhookPort
}

func New(Dependencies) (*Service, error)
```

`ErrDependenciesInvalid` is the stable constructor error;
`ErrWebhookResultInvalid` marks a contradictory/unknown adapter result. The
concrete `notificationwebhook.Client` structurally implements `WebhookPort`,
is constructed by `NewClient() *Client`, and owns the exact stable sentinels
`ErrTargetInvalid`, `ErrRequestInvalid`, `ErrNetworkFailed`, and
`ErrProviderRejected`.

### 3. Contracts

- Store, Secrets and Webhooks are mandatory. Nil and typed-nil dependencies
  wrap `ErrDependenciesInvalid`; no hidden HTTP client/default is constructed.
- The port carries only a supported provider, one URL, optional signing
  secret, bounded text and Unix timestamp. It exposes no method, header, raw
  body, redirect, retry, proxy or general HTTP option. The normalized URL is at
  most 4096 bytes, public hint at most 255 bytes, signing secret at most 512
  bytes and message at most 4000 runes.
- Create and non-empty URL Update call `ValidateTarget`, accept only a nonempty
  bounded normalized URL plus hostname-only hint, then encrypt the URL and
  persist its ciphertext with the plaintext hostname-only hint. An empty
  Update URL preserves the prior URL ciphertext and hint; an empty signing
  secret preserves the prior signing-secret ciphertext.
- The Service owns the unchanged labels
  `notification-channel:v1:<channel-id>:webhook` and
  `notification-channel:v1:<channel-id>:signing`, decrypts only for the
  current call, and never logs or returns plaintext credentials.
- Before every delivery, the adapter validates again and executes the returned
  normalized `WebhookTarget.URL`—never the original unchecked string.
- Target validation trims surrounding whitespace and preserves the
  `url.Parse`/`URL.String` normalization used by legacy rows: HTTPS, no
  userinfo or fragment; `url.Hostname()` equals the supported official
  hostname; WeCom uses exact `/cgi-bin/webhook/send` with nonempty `key` and
  preserves extra query values; Feishu uses a nonempty
  `/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/` suffix and no query. Existing explicit ports remain
  accepted.
- The concrete client has a 15-second timeout, refuses redirects, POSTs
  `application/json` with `User-Agent: Simplus`, emits the existing WeCom
  `msgtype=text`/`text.content` and Feishu
  `msg_type=text`/`content.text` shapes, reads at most 64 KiB plus one byte, and
  requires HTTP 2xx plus explicit numeric `errcode=0`/`code=0`. Optional
  Feishu signing uses the decimal Unix timestamp and
  `base64(HMAC-SHA256(key=timestamp+"\n"+secret, message=""))` formula.
- Target/request/network/rejection failures return exact stable adapter
  sentinels. Raw parse/request/transport/redirect/read/status/provider errors,
  URLs, keys, signing secrets and response bodies are never wrapped or returned
  across the port.
- `cmd/simplusd` constructs `notificationwebhook.NewClient`, injects it through
  `notification.Dependencies`, and on configuration failure logs a bounded
  error, closes stores and exits non-zero before later assembly.
- This introduces no provider feature and changes no OpenAPI, SQLite schema,
  ciphertext format/labels, public error mapping, event kind or Feishu
  application-channel behavior.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Application result and state |
| --- | --- |
| missing/typed-nil Store, Secrets or Webhooks | constructor returns nil and wraps `ErrDependenciesInvalid` |
| invalid provider/target during Create or replacement Update | `ErrChannelInvalid`; no persisted row/ciphertext change |
| empty Update target | preserve existing URL ciphertext and hostname hint |
| empty Update signing secret | preserve existing signing-secret ciphertext |
| adapter preflight returns zero outcome plus error | return the bounded error; no delivery record |
| `delivered` plus nil | persist `success / ""`; persistence failure remains visible |
| `network_failed` plus error | best-effort persist `failed / DELIVERY_NETWORK_FAILED`; return primary error |
| `rejected` plus error | best-effort persist `failed / DELIVERY_REJECTED`; return primary error |
| delivered plus error, failure outcome plus nil, zero plus nil, or unknown outcome | `ErrWebhookResultInvalid`; do not invent a status |
| Webhook/signing decryption fails | no adapter call and no delivery record |
| redirect, transport or context failure returned by `http.Client.Do` | credential-safe `network_failed`; never expose the attempted URL |
| request construction fails before `http.Client.Do` | zero outcome plus credential-safe `ErrRequestInvalid`; no delivery record |
| non-2xx, read/size/JSON/missing/nonzero provider code | credential-safe `rejected`; never expose response content |

Failure-record persistence remains secondary and is deliberately ignored after
an external failure. A successful external delivery followed by success-state
persistence failure returns the store error and is not automatically retried.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: the Service decrypts one stored Feishu bot target/signing secret,
  passes a bounded request, receives `delivered`, persists success and exposes
  only the hostname hint.
- Base: a network failure returns one exact stable adapter error; the Service
  records the existing network-failure code while no credential appears in
  logs, errors or views.
- Bad: the Service builds provider JSON, sets HTTP headers, calls
  `http.Client.Do`, branches on raw response fields, or accepts a port carrying
  caller-selected method/headers/body.

### 6. Tests Required

- `internal/application/notification/service_test.go` uses a recording fake
  port for missing/typed-nil construction; normalized target persistence;
  decrypted provider/URL/signing/message/timestamp handoff; event filtering;
  success/network/rejected/preflight/contradictory/unknown outcomes; ignored
  failure-state write errors; and visible success-state write errors.
- `internal/notificationwebhook/client_test.go` uses synthetic transports only
  and proves both payload/signature shapes, exact headers, URL normalization,
  explicit-port/extra-query compatibility, representative rejected
  target/input classes, exact bounds, per-delivery revalidation,
  redirects/transport/read/size/status/JSON/missing/nonzero code handling and
  no external request for preflight errors.
- Credential privacy tests compare exact returned sentinels/error strings, not
  only `errors.Is`: a `%w` wrapper may satisfy `errors.Is` while leaking a URL,
  key, secret, redirect target or provider body in `Error()`.
- Existing notification SQLite integration, Feishu binding, HTTP and storage
  tests remain green. Run notification/adapter/cmd under `go test -race`, then
  the supported `./cmd/... ./internal/...` test/vet/lint and generated-drift
  scope.
- Focused scans find no `net/http`, provider payload/signing functions or
  official target/path literals in `notification/service.go`, and no
  storage/event/state policy import in `internal/notificationwebhook`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```go
// Wrong: application owns concrete Webhook protocol and can leak URL errors.
response, err := service.Client.Do(request)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("deliver webhook: %w", err)
}

// Correct: application owns outcome policy through a bounded port.
result, err := service.Webhooks.Deliver(ctx, WebhookDeliveryRequest{
    Provider: provider, URL: decryptedURL, SigningSecret: decryptedSecret,
    Message: message, Timestamp: service.Now().Unix(),
})
switch result.Outcome {
case WebhookNetworkFailed:
    _ = service.Store.RecordNotificationDelivery(
        ctx, channelID, "failed", "DELIVERY_NETWORK_FAILED", service.Now().UTC(),
    )
    return err
case WebhookRejected:
    // Persist DELIVERY_REJECTED with the same best-effort rule.
}
```

## Stable Business Identity and Runtime Resolution

Persisted configuration is not the same as live hardware observation.
`internal/application/line/service.go` stores a random Line ID plus immutable
`ManagedModem + SIM/Profile fingerprint + slot` binding, then its `Topology`
method resolves that business Line against the current inventory. Offline,
missing, changed, or ambiguous identities remain unavailable instead of being
rebound by model or port.

Consequences for new work:

- SMS, calls, egress, and Host VoWiFi consume stable Line IDs; they do not save
  `agent-line-*`, USB topology, sysfs, or `/dev` values.
- A `ManagedModem` survives hot-unplug. Resolution by equipment identity and
  conflict handling live in `internal/application/modem/service.go`, with
  persistence in `internal/storage/sqlite/managed_modems.go`.
- Creating a Line is configuration only. `line.Service.Add` re-reads the
  candidate and persists the binding; it does not change RF, start Mihomo or
  Host VoWiFi, send a message, or place a call. These separations are normative
  in `docs/decisions/0018-persistent-lines-and-runtime-resolution.md` and
  `docs/decisions/0019-line-identity-and-communication-paths.md`.

Do not add a fallback that converts a transient scan result into a business
object or silently switches transports when the selected one is unavailable.

## Line-Owned Phone Number Observations

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract whenever a modem or IMS implementation contributes a
current subscriber number, or whenever the authenticated Line response changes
its number observations. Phone numbers are optional current Line observations,
not persisted Line configuration, stable SIM identity, or VoWiFi-owned public
state.

### 2. Signatures

- Model seam: `SubscriberNumberAdapter.ReadSubscriberNumber(context.Context,
  attransport.Query) (string, error)`.
- Agent wire observation: `SIMObservation.subscriberNumber?: string`.
- Normalized hardware observation:
  `SubscriptionProfile.CellularPhoneNumber string`.
- Line-owned optional source: `PhoneNumberSource.CurrentPhoneNumbers(
  context.Context) (map[lineID]e164, error)`.
- Line domain/API: `View.PhoneNumbers []PhoneNumberObservation` and
  `ManagedLine.phoneNumbers: Array<{number, sources}>`, with at most two items
  and source enum `cellular-sim | ims`.

### 3. Contracts

A supported model adapter may add one strictly validated cellular subscriber
number only to the same present, ready, identity-known SIM observation.
`hardware.SubscriptionProfile` and inventory carry that value without changing
the stable SIM fingerprint. The observation is cleared for absent, locked,
inactive, changed, ambiguous, or identity-unknown SIMs.

`internal/application/line` is the sole merger. It combines the current
cellular value with the optional consumer-owned IMS source keyed by stable Line
ID, deduplicates exact E.164 values, keeps source order `cellular-sim`, `ims`,
and sorts observations by number. IMS lookup is best effort and is used only
for `List` and mutation display views; `Topology` for SMS, calls, egress, and
VoWiFi control never consults it. The authenticated
`ManagedLine.phoneNumbers` response is the only public owner; persistence,
ordinary logs, errors, SSE, hardware/setup responses, and public VoWiFi state
exclude phone numbers.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Empty adapter or IMS result -> omit that source; the Line remains usable.
- Unique explicit `+E.164` value (`^\\+[1-9][0-9]{2,14}$`) -> carry it.
- QDC507 empty `AT+CNUM` result -> unavailable without failing the probe.
- QDC507 duplicate/multiple, non-145, missing `+`, echo, URC, overflow,
  malformed CSV, or non-`OK` transcript -> unavailable without guessing.
- Agent number without ready state and SIM identity fingerprint, or malformed
  number -> reject the probe payload.
- Locked/inactive/missing/mismatched profile -> clear the cellular value.
- IMS source failure, malformed value, duplicate Line ID, or offline worker ->
  omit IMS for that view; do not change `Topology` availability.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: cellular and IMS return different valid values; return both, sorted by
  number, each with its own source.
- Base: only one source returns a value; return one observation. If both return
  the same value, return one observation with both ordered sources.
- Bad: persist a prior number, infer one from IMEI/IMSI/ICCID/operator data, or
  expose a model command/source selector through Web/API.

### 6. Tests Required

- Adapter fixtures assert the exact fixed command and all accepted/rejected
  transcript shapes without real identifiers.
- Agent/hardware/inventory tests assert validation, round trip, revision
  participation, and clearing on absent/locked/swapped/unknown identity.
- Line tests assert empty/single/same/different merges, deterministic order,
  IMS best effort, and zero IMS-source calls from `Topology`.
- OpenAPI/HTTP/Web tests assert the bounded schema, removal from public VoWiFi
  state, and rendering of all values on desktop and mobile.
- Privacy/source scans assert no persistence field, real number, raw transcript,
  model branch above the adapter, log/error/SSE exposure, or arbitrary AT seam.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong: the Lines page reads `voWiFi.phoneNumber`, or a Line service branches on
`QDC507` and executes `AT+CNUM` itself.

Correct: the model adapter emits an optional typed cellular observation; Line
merges it with optional IMS evidence; Web renders only
`ManagedLine.phoneNumbers` and knows neither modem model nor AT/IMS protocol.

## Model Isolation and Capability Evidence

The dependency direction in `docs/architecture.md` is enforced by current
code:

```text
application intent -> Agent typed capability -> model adapter -> protocol I/O
```

- `internal/modemadapter/registry.go` owns USB match rules, endpoint roles,
  model-specific capability interfaces, and the fail-closed registry. Its
  `Match` returns no adapter when rules overlap;
  `internal/modemadapter/registry_test.go` protects
  that behavior and rejects shared dynamic USB IDs.
- `internal/hardwareprobe/scanner.go` selects an adapter from the registry and
  orchestrates probing. It does not manufacture model commands.
- `internal/attransport/transport.go` owns tty session mechanics. Its `Query`
  is a compiled-in adapter seam, never a Web/API input.
- `internal/application/inventory/agent_source.go` maps only `observed`
  evidence to business capabilities; descriptors or documented/unverified
  features do not become operational support.

Add a new model by implementing and registering the smallest existing
capability interfaces plus tests/evidence. If upper layers need
`if model == ...`, a VID/PID, an interface number, a vendor response, or a
device path, the adapter contract is leaking and must be corrected or recorded
as an explicit design exception.

## Side-Effect Ordering and Uncertain Outcomes

Operations with external effects must make ordering and uncertainty visible.
The messaging service is the representative contract:

- `Service.Send` validates the request and Line, encodes the body, persists a
  queued record, and only then calls `Sender.SendSMS`.
- A per-modem `serialGate` prevents concurrent dispatch through the same modem
  function.
- Operation IDs make an identical retry replayable; conflicting parameters are
  rejected by `internal/storage/sqlite/messages.go`.
- Lost or partial outcomes become `unconfirmed` with stable codes such as
  `SMS_SEND_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`; they are not blindly resent.
- `internal/application/messaging/service_test.go` proves
  persistence-before-dispatch, replay, conflict, and
  restart behavior against a temporary real SQLite store.

Likewise, `internal/application/calls/service.go` rejects known emergency and
uncertain short numbers before the simulated call transition, and serializes
active-call state. A future real call transport must preserve that ordering;
Simulator success is not hardware evidence.

## Error Contract

Use package sentinel/domain errors for expected decisions and wrap them with
`%w` when adding context. `messaging.ErrLineUnavailable`,
`line.ErrCandidateInvalid`, and `sms.ErrOperationConflict` are examples.
Transport-specific detail is reduced to bounded stable codes before it crosses
the service boundary. Public mapping belongs in `httpapi.Server`, not in the
service or storage package.

Avoid branching on free-form `err.Error()` for new contracts. Existing string
classification in `httpapi.writeMihomoSubscriptionError` is a localized
legacy behavior, not a pattern to copy; prefer typed errors that can be tested
with `errors.Is` or `errors.As`.

## Current Capability Limits

Describe current assembly, not a planned universal platform:

- `cmd/simplusd/main.go` wires calls and eUICC only for the Simulator backend.
- The hardware backend wires the HIL-accepted QDC507 native SMS transport and
  can additionally wire Host VoWiFi SMS through a typed supervisor. Real calls
  and other ordinary cellular SMS transports are not production capabilities.
- `modemadapter.DefaultRegistry` remains SMS-closed, while the production Agent
  explicitly composes the QDC507 transport, durable store, adapter, registry,
  shared operation gate, and resolver. Registry and Agent tests protect both
  sides of that boundary.

Tests or UI fixtures must not be used to advertise a real hardware capability.
Update `docs/compatibility.md` only when the stated evidence level is actually
met.


## Scenario: Second control transport and bridged capability evidence

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply this contract when adding a control transport beside the Linux tty path,
when publishing a device that USB sysfs cannot discover, or when capability
evidence has to describe a control path that Simplus has not proven on real
hardware.

### 2. Signatures

- Transport seam: `attransport.Opener.Open(string) (Session, error)` and
  `Session.Query(context.Context, string, time.Duration) ([]string, error)`.
- Out-of-package failure classification:
  `attransport.NewOpenError(kind string, retryable bool, cause error)`. The
  cause stays unexported so a transport cannot leak an endpoint path, URL or
  credential through `Error()`.
- Bridged transport: `internal/atremote` (`Target`, `NewTarget`, `NewOpener`,
  `Locator`, `ParseLocator`, `NewRoutingOpener`, `LoadConfig`).
- Injection points: `hardwareprobe.NewATQuerierWithOpener` and
  `hardwareprobe.Scanner.ExtraDevices func(context.Context)
  ([]agentapi.DeviceReport, error)`.
- Device synthesis: `hardwareprobe.BridgeSpec` and
  `hardwareprobe.NewBridgeDeviceSource(registry, specs, locator)`.

### 3. Contracts

Implement `attransport.Opener` rather than `hardwareprobe.ModemQuerier`. The
Opener seam reuses `executeATProbe`'s identity/presence/serial ordering and
every `modemadapter` method unchanged; reimplementing `ModemQuerier` duplicates
that orchestration and lets the two paths drift.

A second transport must reproduce the tty session's bounds exactly: command
non-empty, at most `maximumCommandLength`, no CR/LF; response capped at
`maximumResponseSize`; lines returned only once `HasTerminalResponse` holds;
control characters, empty lines and the echoed command removed. If the two
transports disagree on a bound, transport choice silently changes adapter
behavior. `splitLines`/`safeText` are unexported and Linux-tagged, so a portable
transport carries its own equivalent and pins parity with a test rather than
exporting transport internals or dropping the build tag.

Transport selection is deterministic routing on the endpoint locator, never
fallback. `NewRoutingOpener` sends bridge-scheme locators to the bridged
transport and everything else to the platform transport, and returns the
selected transport's error unchanged. A locator whose scheme matches but whose
key is malformed still routes to the bridged transport, which rejects it: making
routing depend on key validity would let a typo reach the local tty path.

The locator travels in `agentapi.Endpoint.Node`, the field that already carries
`/dev/ttyUSB2`. It must carry no host, port, path or credential; those belong to
the transport's reviewed target table. Prove the invariant with a source scan
asserting the scheme constant is referenced only by the transport package and
its composition root, so no application, API, protocol or adapter layer can
branch on local versus bridged.

Contributed devices must be deterministic and content-stable.
`agentapi.Monitor` derives snapshot revisions and per-device generations from
report content, so a source that varies between scans churns generations and
invalidates queued operations. Build reports once, return copies, leave
`Generation` zero, and use an identity namespace distinct from
`stableDeviceID`'s `usb-`.

Do not fabricate a USB descriptor for a device that has none, and do not
hardcode a model's interface number in generic inventory code. Discover it by
offering candidate interfaces to the adapter until it resolves the synthesized
endpoint as its primary control role.

Refuse to publish a profile whose adapter owns its own driver transport (for
example `modemadapter.SMSAdapter`). Publishing it produces a device that looks
operable and then fails inside a transport this seam does not provide.

Capability evidence does not transfer across control paths. An adapter's
`observed` statuses come from bounded HIL on a locally attached module, so a
bridged device downgrades every `observed` entry to `EvidenceUnverified` with
evidence naming the reason. That is fail-closed by construction:
`inventory/agent_source.go` maps only `observed` evidence to business
capabilities, and `hardwareprobe/simaka.go` refuses SIM authentication. Probing
still works, so an operator can confirm reachability before deciding anything.
An explicit per-bridge operator attestation may preserve the adapter statuses;
it must append attestation text to each observed entry, be logged at startup,
and be documented as attested rather than observed. This is the recorded
exception required by [Model Isolation and Capability
Evidence](#model-isolation-and-capability-evidence).

Credentials for a remote peer come from a private file, not flags or
environment values: a command line is readable by any local process through
`/proc`. Require a regular non-symlink file with `mode & 0o077 == 0`, bound its
size before decode, reject unknown JSON fields, and keep the host, credential
and attempted URL out of every returned error.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| command empty, over the bound, or containing CR/LF | rejected before any I/O |
| response over the size bound, or over the line-count bound | bounded error, no partial result |
| response without a terminal status | error; never returned as success lines |
| peer reports busy / auth failure / bad request / not implemented / anything else | `OpenBusy` retryable / `OpenPermission` / `OpenConfigure` retryable / `OpenUnsupported` / `OpenUnavailable` retryable |
| unknown or malformed locator key | `OpenUnavailable`, not retryable, peer not contacted |
| selected transport fails | error returned; the other transport is never attempted |
| configured transport cannot be assembled | executable exits non-zero; never degrade to the other transport silently |
| contributed device ID missing or colliding with a discovered device | `Scan` fails closed |
| profile unknown, owning a driver transport, or accepting no synthesized endpoint | source construction fails |
| bridged device without operator attestation | every capability at most `unverified`; SIM authentication returns `ErrSIMAKAUnsupported` |
| configuration file group/world accessible, symlinked, oversize, or with unknown fields | load fails with a credential-safe error |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a bridged ML307A appears with a stable identity, probes to
  `ProbeStateComplete` through the routing opener, and exposes no business
  capability until an operator attests it.
- Base: the bridge is unreachable. The device stays listed with a retryable
  typed probe error, exactly like an unplugged tty endpoint; inventory does not
  invent or delete business objects.
- Bad: relax `filepath.IsAbs` in the tty session so one transport serves two
  mechanisms; try the local opener when the bridged one fails; copy the
  adapter's observed evidence onto a bridge; hardcode interface 2 in the device
  source; put the bridge URL or credential in the locator or in an error string.

### 6. Tests Required

- Transport tests against a synthetic peer covering every status in the matrix,
  the exact command and response bounds, line normalization, caller
  cancellation, stale peer session, redirect refusal, and that `Error()` never
  names the peer.
- A routing test asserting both directions and, explicitly, that a failure on
  one side never reaches the other.
- Source scans: no command literal inside the transport, and the locator scheme
  confined to the transport plus its composition root. Give the literal matcher
  a positive/negative self-check so the scan cannot become vacuous.
- Device-source tests for determinism, caller-mutation isolation, the adapter's
  interface expectation across several numbers, and both evidence policies
  including the SIM authentication gate.
- Configuration tests for every rejected file and document shape, plus an
  assertion that the error text carries no credential or host.
- Optional real-peer evidence belongs in an env-guarded, read-only test that
  fails closed on an unavailable probe state. It must issue no write, RF change
  or SIM mutation.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong: make availability decide the transport, and let the peer's identity leak
into the failure:

```go
if session, err := bridge.Open(endpoint); err == nil {
    return session, nil
}
return local.Open(endpoint) // silent transport switch
```

Correct: route on the locator and return the selected transport's classified
failure:

```go
if atremote.IsLocator(endpoint) {
    return bridge.Open(endpoint) // never falls through
}
return local.Open(endpoint)
```
